# you must be told, 1 means print all errors, even ones that are not important
# Level 0 is the default
ERROR_LEVEL=<%= @error_level %>

# Debug level, practical range 0-10, higher number means more output
# Level 1 is a useful level if you want to see what's been done and
# don't want to read /var/log/yum.log
# Level 0 is the default

# if MAILTO is set and the mail command is available, the mail command

# by default MAILTO is unset, so crond mails the output by itself
# example:  MAILTO=root
